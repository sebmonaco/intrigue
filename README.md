## What is this?
Intrigue lets you quickly organize the papers you read alongside your thoughts in a visual & clean manner.
Features include:
* Automatically pull metadata of **papers (using DOI), books (using ISBN), BibTeX, and web links** using [Citation.js](https://citation.js.org).
* Double clicking reference nodes takes you to a PDF at you-know-where.
* Full **WYSIWYG** markdown support in the notes, powered by [TipTap](https://www.tiptap.dev).
* Everything can be **grouped, snapped, and connected**.
* _COMING SOON: Import BibTeX files exported from a literature search or other tools like Zotero._
* _COMING SOON: Export papers into a BibTeX to directly use in your paper-writing process._
