## What is this?
Intrigue lets you quickly organize the papers you read alongside your thoughts in a visual & clean manner.
Features include:
* Automatically pull paper metadata from just a DOI using [Citation.js](https://citation.js.org).
* Full **WYSIWYG** markdown support in the notes, powered by [TipTap](https://www.tiptap.dev).
* Everything can be grouped, snapped, and connected.
* _COMING SOON: Export papers into a BibTeX to directly use in your paper-writing process._

## How to use?
It's simple!
* **Create notes:** Double click to create a note.
  * Enter an DOI into a note to have it automatically turned into a paper note.
* **Snap notes:** Drag one note onto another to snap them together.
* **Connect notes:** Select a note, hold Command and click other notes to connect.
  * Click again to disconnect.
* **Pan canvas:** Hold space to pan the canvas.
